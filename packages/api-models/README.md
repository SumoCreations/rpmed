# API-Models

A shared library containing helpers to build complex queries with dynamo. Eventually we may store all models within this library if we find a good solution to refactor our models implementation.

To test this project:

```
yarn workspace api-models test
```

To build this project:

```
yarn workspace api-models build
```
